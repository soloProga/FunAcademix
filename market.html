						<h1>Product</h1>
                        <p class="just">Funacademix offers tutoring services to class 3 and 4 students in an attempt to better their understanding in Maths, and English,  therefore, doing their best whilst sitting the Common Entrance Exam. Funacademix guides customers via an online media platform with the help of educational games which pique the children’s interest and increase their will to learn. The game-oriented teaching style and reduced number of students in a room are what differentiates us from other online tutoring services and will further interest children and parents in our business instead of competitors. Seeing as Funacademix is a new and unknown business the firm will use early customers as references to prove the business’ legitimacy; the business will offer free tutoring sessions to a group of customers and ask for feedback on our site and promotion via word of mouth and social media..</p>
                        <h1>Price</h1>
                        <p class="just">The business applies value-based pricing by offering customers the choice of paying $15 for a 1-hour session or $30 for a 2-hour session. Due to our low prices compared to other tutoring services the business may suffer making little profit. Some customers may make a price-quality attribution and assume our business to be a low-quality tutoring service due to our prices; this will more likely occur upon viewing social media rather than a recommendation from our reference customers and new customers. In time, when Funacademix becomes more known and in higher demand, the firm will make changes within the marketing strategy including prices as the business grows.</p>
                        <h1>Promotion</h1>
                        <p class="just">Funacademix will outsource to a marketing firm for advertising, utilize Meta media such as Facebook and Instagram and viral marketing, encouraging customers to pass the word on from person to person or social media. Unfortunately, the firm is both small in size and target group therefore we refrain from emphasizing public service instead we will develop a press kit on our website and display comments from our customers.</p>
                        <h1>Place</h1>
                        <p class="just"> Due to the recent pandemic, social interaction on a physical scale has been reduced, therefore, to assure the safety of customers and staff, preferably the service is carried out via online interaction. Considering the business does not have its own media platform we rely on the well-known app Microsoft Teams, as a free intermediary to tutor clients.</p>
